  Lines:
  - Yo! I'm gonna tell you how to get your camera set up.
  - Right click to open it. Left click to take a photo once it's open.
  - Use Q and E to adjust the focal distance.
  - The "focal distance" changes how far away from the camera things will be in focus.
  - The camera has a short focal range for now, so only a small area will be in focus.
  - The jellyfish anomaly moves pretty slow, so let's start with that.
  - Take a photo of it.
  - The photo has to be in focus.
  - Once you get an in-focus photo, return to me!
